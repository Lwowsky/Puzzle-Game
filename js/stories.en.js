      "Naruto was born in the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha), the son of Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki.",
      "On the night of his birth, Kushina had the Nine-Tailed Fox (Kurama) sealed inside her. During childbirth, the seal weakens—and a masked attacker takes advantage of it, releasing Kurama and turning it against Konoha. The village stands on the brink of destruction.",
      "To save everyone, Minato makes the hardest decision of his life: he seals Kurama into the newborn Naruto, making him a jinchūriki. The cost is terrible—Minato and Kushina die protecting their son and their village.",
      "From his very first moments, Naruto becomes an orphan—and at the same time, the bearer of a power that many would later fear and avoid.",

      "The night of the Nine-Tails has passed, but Konoha still trembles among the ruins. Smoke slowly fades into the cold air, and people move like shadows—searching for loved ones, repeating names that will never return.",
      "They speak of the new jinchūriki in whispers. No one sees a child in the infant—they see a seal, fear, and the unknown. And though Naruto sleeps peacefully, the shadow of suspicion has already fallen over him.",
      "Somewhere between the wreckage, a new rule is born: stay silent about the truth. The secret of the seal is meant to protect Naruto… and at the same time, it condemns him to loneliness.",
      "And so his path begins—without steps, without words, but already carrying a burden too heavy for even an adult shinobi.",

      "Once again, he is alone. His attempts to get attention have led nowhere, and even the teachers look at him differently. In the crowd, he sees everyone—except those who truly see him.",

      "Snatches of conversation drift from the hallway along with other people's views some people turn away, some whisper. Naruto doesn’t understand why, but he gets used to pretending he doesn’t care.",
      "The teacher begins the lesson, and Naruto stares at the board, clenching his fists. If they won’t accept him, he’ll force them to notice. Not through fear or rumors, but through strength and stubborn will.",
      "That day, he decides for the first time—truly and seriously: one day, he will become Hokage. And then no one will be able to look at him as if he were an outsider.",

      "Kakashi steps forward—calm, but taut like a drawn bowstring. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura feel a fear unlike anything from school sparring: this isn’t a game or training. One mistake here can cost a life.",

      "And so their first true duel ignites—not out of hatred, but out of a need to prove who they are. On the training field, Naruto’s fire of determination clashes with Sasuke’s shadow of pride.",

      "Sasuke notices Naruto is starting to catch up—and it wounds his pride more than any blow. He trains until it hurts, until his hands tremble, but the feeling of “not enough” won’t go away.",
      "One goal rises again and again in his mind: power at any cost. He begins avoiding conversations, turning away from the team, and even Sakura’s gaze can’t stop him anymore.",
      "In the night silence of Konoha, Sasuke stands alone and realizes something terrifying: if he stays here, he may never become who he wants to be. And in that moment, the darkness feels as if someone has been watching for a long time—waiting for him to take the step into the abyss.",

      "At the edge of the village, unfamiliar figures stop him. They don’t shout or threaten—they speak calmly, almost politely, but their words are a trap: “The power you seek isn’t born in warmth. It comes in darkness.”",
      "Sasuke stays silent for a long time. Faces of the team flash in his mind—Sakura’s voice, Naruto with his stubbornness… and at the same time, that unbearable thought: “I’m falling behind. I’m not fast enough. I’m weaker than I should be.” He takes a step forward—and decides.",
      "When morning touches Konoha’s rooftops, Sasuke’s bed in the barracks is empty. Only cool air by an open window, and the feeling that someone has torn a page from their lives. And far beyond the gates, a thin trail of footprints already stretches out—the beginning of the chase.",

      "Naruto arrives with his last strength—scratched, breathless, but with stubborn fire in his eyes. He speaks of the team, of coming back, of how it’s not too late to stop. But the answer is cold: “I need power. And I’ll take it, even if I have to cut away everything unnecessary.”",
      "Words no longer matter—only the fight remains. They rush at each other, and every hit sounds like something breaking inside. Naruto fights to bring his friend back, while Sasuke fights to prove to himself he can go all the way without looking back.",
      "When chakra erupts at the limit, the Valley trembles: Rasengan meets Chidori, light collides with lightning, and the water beneath their feet explodes into spray. For a moment, they freeze in that clash—two friends turned rivals. And even when the fight ends, the sense of loss remains: their paths split, and behind Naruto there is only silence and the echo of last words.",

      "Rain murmurs beyond the window, and Konoha seems quieter than ever. The door creaks, and a man steps inside with a strange smile, white hair, and red markings under his eyes. A small toad sits on his shoulder.",
      "“You must be that kid who doesn’t know how to give up,” he says, and there’s something familiar in his voice—lightness, but also wisdom born of pain. This is Jiraiya, one of the Legendary Sannin, a former student of the Third Hokage.",
      "He sits beside Naruto, not speaking about defeat—only about the path. He says true strength isn’t hatred or running away, but getting back up again. And for the first time in many days, Naruto smiles. Because he understands: a new chapter is ahead. He will grow stronger, and someday he will bring Sasuke home.",

      "One evening, after exhausting training, a tall man with white hair landed on a nearby rooftop. Jiraiya grinned like they’d known each other for a hundred years and said, “Well then, kid—ready to finally learn for real?”",
      "Naruto wanted to snap back right away, but he felt power in this man—and a strange warmth. Not pity. Not fear. Real confidence, as if Jiraiya saw not a seal in him, but a person.",
      "And so the first lessons began: chakra control until his hands ached, endurance drills, and classes where Jiraiya suddenly grew serious. “You’re not just a ninja, Naruto. You’re the future. And the future has to be forged.”",

      "They wandered past stalls for a long time, and Jiraiya watched Naruto with unexpected attention, as if measuring him not as a student—but as who he was going to become. In the end, he stopped at a shop selling shinobi gear.",
      "The new outfit was comfortable, tough, and nothing like his old worn clothes. The jacket settled on his shoulders as if it had been tailored for him, and the gloves and belt made him look… grown-up.",
      "At first Naruto was thrown off—he wasn’t used to someone spending money on him just because. Jiraiya put a hand on his head and said quietly, “This isn’t a gift. It’s a sign. You’re growing—and I won’t let you lose your way.”",

      "Jiraiya pushed him to do the impossible: keep chakra control when his heart is pounding; stay clear-headed when rage rises inside; resist the power that whispers from the dark.",
      "“You can’t afford to be nothing but anger,” Jiraiya said, looking him straight in the eyes. “If you are, someone else will pull your strings. You have to lead.”",

      "Naruto wanted to go with him, but for the first time Jiraiya cut him off harshly: “You’re not ready yet. And that’s exactly why—you have to stay alive.” There was more care than command in those words.",
      "In the Rain Village, Jiraiya encountered a shadow that felt like a legend. That’s when he first saw Pain—cold and imposing, like judgment from the heavens. Pain spoke of “pain” as the world’s only truth, and every word sounded like a sentence.",
      "The fight was uneven. Jiraiya fought not for glory, but for knowledge he had to deliver—for the student he had to protect. And even when he had almost nothing left, he didn’t think about himself.",
      "With his last strength, he left a message—a sign meant to lead Naruto to the answer. And then the rain took him, the way Amegakure takes everything. Naruto lost his teacher… but gained a legacy: a path he now had to see through to the end.",

      "Fukasaku and Shima greeted him without extra words. No one asked if he was ready—they tested him. Naruto learned to stand perfectly still, to listen to the world, to feel natural energy as if it were breathing beside him.",
      "The first attempts were painful: the energy slipped away, his body ached, his thoughts scattered. But Naruto stubbornly returned to the silence. Day by day, he became more precise, calmer, more grown-up.",

      "Kurama stayed silent for a long time. In his eyes were centuries of hatred—and also loneliness. Naruto didn’t look away. He reached out a hand, not as a victor, but as someone who also knows what it means to be rejected.",

      "Their meeting became a collision of two wills: Sasuke, who sought revenge and truth, and Danzō, who was used to sacrificing others for a “greater goal.”",
      "There was no mercy in the fight. Blades and techniques cut through the air, and their stares were sharper than kunai. Sasuke knew that if he stopped even for a moment, the darkness would win.",
