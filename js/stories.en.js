    text: [
      "Naruto was born in the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha) as the son of Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki.",
      "On the night of his birth, Kushina had the Nine-Tailed Fox (Kurama) sealed inside her. During childbirth the seal weakened—and a masked attacker took advantage of it, releasing Kurama and turning it against Konoha. The village stood on the brink of destruction.",
      "To save everyone, Minato made the hardest decision of his life: he sealed Kurama inside newborn Naruto, making him a jinchuriki. The price was terrible—Minato and Kushina died protecting their son and the village.",
      "So from his very first moments, Naruto became an orphan—and at the same time the bearer of a power many would later fear and avoid.",

      "The night of the Nine-Tails has passed, but Konoha still trembles among the ruins. Smoke slowly fades in the cold air, and people move like shadows—searching for loved ones, remembering names that will never return.",
      "They speak of the new jinchuriki in whispers. No one sees a baby as a child—they see a seal, fear, and the unknown. And though Naruto sleeps peacefully, the shadow of others’ suspicion already falls over him.",
      "Somewhere between the broken stones a new rule is born: stay silent about the truth. The secret of the seal is meant to protect Naruto… and at the same time it condemns him to loneliness.",
      "Thus his path begins—still without steps, without words, but already with a burden too heavy even for an adult shinobi.",

    text: [
      "It’s graduation day at the Ninja Academy. The students rejoice, hug one another, and share their dreams about the future.",
      "And a little off to the side—on an old swing—sits Naruto.",
      "Once again, he’s left alone. His attempts to get attention have led nowhere, and even the teachers look at him differently. In the crowd he sees everyone—except those who see him.",
      "In that moment, a promise is born in the boy’s heart: “I’ll become the strongest. I’ll make them see me.”",

    text: [
      "The Academy doors open, and Naruto stops at the threshold as if facing a new world. Inside it’s loud—kids laugh, argue, show off—while he feels out of place, like a shadow.",
      "From the hallway come fragments of conversations and чужі погляди. Someone turns away, someone whispers—Naruto doesn’t understand why, but he’s grown used to pretending he doesn’t care.",
      "The teacher begins the lesson, and Naruto stares at the board, clenching his fists. If they won’t accept him—he’ll force them to notice. Not with fear or rumors, but with strength and stubborn determination.",
      "That day, for the first time, he truly decides: one day he will become Hokage. And then no one will ever look at him as if he were an outsider again.",
    ],
